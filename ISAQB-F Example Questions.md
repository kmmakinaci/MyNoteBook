# ISAQB-F Preparation

* Which of the following is not a software design principle
  * encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Normalization
* What are the for key terms on common definitions of software architecture
  * Building blocks
  * Relationships
  * Components
  * Interfaces
* Name the three most important fields of template based architecture documentation
  * To describe module structures (white boxes())
  * To describe individual archtectural modules and their external intefaces(black boxes)
  * To use a standardized document structure
* Which of the following techniques are best suited to illustrate the interaction of runtime building blocks?
  * activity diagrams
  * sequence diagrams
  * state diagram
  * flowcharts
  * class diagrams
  * tabular description of interfaces
  * Depiction of screen flows (sequence of user interactions)
  * Numbered list of sequential steps
* The following statements about quality characteristics are more most accurate
  * Flexinility reduces testability
  * Simplicity increases comprehensibility
* Which  quality characteristics are the software architect responsible
  * the performance of the software
  * the suitability of the software design for its purpose
* Following items can be building blocks of a software architecture
  * an algorithm
  * a component
  * a class
  * a package
* Which of the foloowing statements about (croscutting) concepts are most appropriate?
  * Concepts are a means to increase consistency
  * Uniform exception handling is most easily achieved when architects agree with developers upon a suitable concept prior to implementation.
  * A concept can define constraints for the implementation of many building blocks 
* Most desirable characteristics of interfaces
  * Geared towards the capabilities of the provider
  * clear descriptions of assertions and prerequisites
  * Remotely callable

* What are the main goals of software architecture

  [  ] Improve pattern compliance in the structure and implementation of the system

  [X] Achieve necessary quality  requirements for the system in a comprehensible way.

  [  ] Enable cost-effective integration and acceptance testing of the system.

  [X] Provide the development team and other stakeholders with a basic understanding of the system's structures and concepts.
  
* Explain why it is often necessary or helpful to support requirements engineers or business analyst in clarifying requirements.

* Explain why some requirements (especially quality requirements) need to be prioritized. Consider potential contradictions or conflicts between such requirements.

* Name at least five different activities or approaches that could support your task of "Shepherd implementation"

* Think of problems that occurred when stakeholders from different groups needed to understand the technical consequences of their requests.

* think of situations where the architects needed to explain the consequences of business or quality requirements in relation to budget, schedule or risk.
