# Technical Report: Software Deployment Using Nginx for Embedded Devices and COTS Servers
## Introduction
This report describes the approach of using Nginx as a web server to serve released versions of software for deployment to embedded devices and Commercial Off-The-Shelf (COTS) servers. The system is designed to allow devices to fetch the latest software releases from a central Nginx server.
## Deployment Overview
The goal of the deployment process is to enable endpoint devices to download the latest software releases from a central server running Nginx. The software is packaged (e.g., Docker images, binaries, or tarballs) and uploaded to the Nginx server, where it is made available for download. Endpoint devices then fetch and install the latest release automatically or manually.
## Detailed Deployment Steps
1. **Build and Tag Software in GitHub**: The software is built and tagged with a release version. For example, a Docker image or a binary is created.
2. **Push Software to Nginx Server**: The software release is uploaded to the Nginx server for distribution. The Nginx server is configured to serve the release files.
3. **Configure Nginx Server**: Nginx is configured to serve the software release files over HTTP. The configuration includes setting up the directory structure and handling release versions.
4. **Fetch Software on Endpoint Devices**: The endpoint devices can either automatically or manually download the latest release from the Nginx server. A script can be used to fetch the latest version and install it.
5. **Install the Software on Endpoint**: After downloading, the software is extracted, installed, and executed on the endpoint device. Optionally, services on the endpoint device are restarted to use the new release.
6. **Optional**: The Nginx server can be reloaded to reflect any changes, such as a new release becoming the default.
## Nginx Configuration
The Nginx server is configured to serve the software releases stored in a specified directory. Below is an example of the Nginx configuration to serve the software:
```nginx
server {
    listen 80;
    server_name yourdomain.com;

    location /releases/ {
        root /var/www;
        autoindex on;
    }

    location /latest-release/ {
        return 301 /releases/latest-release.tar.gz;
    }
}
```
This configuration exposes the releases directory under `/releases/` on the Nginx server, and optionally redirects `/latest-release/` to always serve the latest release.

## Endpoint Device Download Script
A script can be used on the endpoint device to automatically download and install the latest software release. Below is an example of such a script:

```bash
#!/bin/bash
SERVER_URL='http://yourdomain.com/releases'
wget ${SERVER_URL}/latest-release.tar.gz -O /tmp/latest-release.tar.gz
tar -xvzf /tmp/latest-release.tar.gz -C /opt/your-app
cd /opt/your-app
./install.sh  # Example install script, adjust as needed
# Restart service if needed
sudo systemctl restart your-app-service
```

This script downloads the latest release, extracts it, installs the software, and optionally restarts the service running the application.
## Other Deployment Approaches
While using Nginx to serve software releases is a valid and simple solution, other approaches may be more appropriate depending on the system's complexity and scale. Here are a few alternatives:
*a.* **Package Repositories**: For Linux-based systems, using package managers (e.g., .deb or .rpm) can simplify installation, update, and dependency management.
*b.* **Docker Container Registry**: If the application is containerized, using a Docker registry (e.g., Docker Hub, AWS ECR) can streamline Docker image distribution.
*c.* **OTA (Over-The-Air) Solutions**: For embedded devices, solutions like Mender, BalenaCloud, or Hawkbit offer specialized software update management.

## Conclusion
Using Nginx for software release distribution is an effective and straightforward method for managing software updates on embedded and COTS devices. This centralized approach allows endpoint devices to fetch and install the latest software versions. While other methods such as package management, Docker registries, and OTA solutions may be more suitable for complex systems, Nginx provides a simple and effective solution for smaller-scale deployments.
