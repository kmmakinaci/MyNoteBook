"CompareAndCopySheets - Compare and copy data between two sheets based on a common column value
Below is a macro that will compare 'Column D' in both sheets
then checks 'Column L' if a match is found.
It will then highlight rows in red for changed values, green for new rows,
and add a new column with either "changed" or "new" in the first sheet.
Then copy the entire row data from the second sheet to the first sheet if 'Column L' matches.
Please adjust the column numbers and headers as needed.
sheet1 should include the updated data and sheet2 should include the original data.
