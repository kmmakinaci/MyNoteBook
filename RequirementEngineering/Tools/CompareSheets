"Below is a macro that will compare 'Column D' in both sheets
then checks 'Column L' if a match is found.
It will then highlight rows in red for changed values, green for new rows,
and add a new column with either "changed" or "new" in the first sheet.
Please adjust the column numbers and headers as needed.
sheet1 should include the updated data and sheet2 should include the original data.
