  * encapsulation
  * Inheritance
  * Polymorphism
  * Normalization
* What are the for key terms on common definitions of software architecture
  * Building blocks
  * Relationships
  * Components
  * Interfaces

- Name some common elements of software architecture definitions.

- What kind of things in your system might be influenced by architectural decisions?

* Name the three most important fields of template based architecture documentation
  * To describe module structures (white boxes())
  * To describe individual architectural modules and their external interfaces(black boxes)
  * To use a standardized document structure

* Which of the following techniques are best suited to illustrate the interaction of runtime building blocks?
  * activity diagrams
  * sequence diagrams
  * state diagram
  * flowcharts
  * class diagrams
  * tabular description of interfaces
  * Depiction of screen flows (sequence of user interactions)
  * Numbered list of sequential steps

* The following statements about quality characteristics are more most accurate
  * Flexibility reduces testability
  * Simplicity increases comprehensibility

* Which  quality characteristics are the software architect responsible
  * the performance of the software
  * the suitability of the software design for its purpose

* Following items can be building blocks of a software architecture
  * an algorithm
  * a component
  * a class
  * a package

* Which of the following statements about (cross-cutting) concepts are most appropriate?
  * Concepts are a means to increase consistency
  * Uniform exception handling is most easily achieved when architects agree with developers upon a suitable concept prior to implementation.
  * A concept can define constraints for the implementation of many building blocks

* P-question: Which of the following requirements must be met before creating or developing a software architecture.

  Select the two most appropriate.

  [ ] All requirement are provided in a complete, detailed and consistent manner.

  [x] The most important quality requirements are known.

  [x] Organizational constraints and conditions are known.

  [ ] The programming language has been selected.

  [ ] Hardware for the development team has been provided.

* Most desirable characteristics of interfaces
  * Geared towards the capabilities of the provider
  * clear descriptions of assertions and prerequisites
  * Remotely callable

* What are the main goals of software architecture

  [  ] Improve pattern compliance in the structure and implementation of the system

  [X] Achieve necessary quality  requirements for the system in a comprehensible way.

  [  ] Enable cost-effective integration and acceptance testing of the system.

  [X] Provide the development team and other stakeholders with a basic understanding of the system's structures and concepts.

* Explain why it is often necessary or helpful to support requirements engineers or business analyst in clarifying requirements.

* Explain why some requirements (especially quality requirements) need to be prioritized. Consider potential contradictions or conflicts between such requirements.

* Name at least five different activities or approaches that could support your task of "Shepherd implementation"

* Think of problems that occurred when stakeholders from different groups needed to understand the technical consequences of their requests.

* think of situations where the architects needed to explain the consequences of business or quality requirements in relation to budget, schedule or risk.

* Select two most appropriate answers.

  [  ] In object-oriented systems, iteration can help reduce the coupling introduced by inheritance

  [x] Short iterations can provide fast feedback on architectural decisions

  [  ] Iteration cycles guarantee faster development

  [x] Iteration cycles help to identify risks and problems earlier, providing more time to resolve them.

* K question

  [T] Project goals can include functional requirements as well as quality requirements

  [T] Architectural goals are derived form th quality requirements of the system or product

  [F] Business stakeholders should concentrate on business goals and not interface with architectural goals

  [F] To avoid conflicts, business goals and architectural goals should be non overlapping sets.

* Name a few typical short-term goals: What goals is your project manager aiming for?

* What factors influence short term decisions more than other?

* In contrast, think of a few typical long-term goals, apart from maintainability of the system.

* Explain why neither of these types of goals (short/long) should be called better than the other.

* Select the three most appropriate of the following statements about cross-cutting concepts

  [ ] Uniform usage of concepts reduces coupling between building blocks.

  [ ] The definition of appropriate concepts ensures the pattern compliance of the architecture

  [ ] For each use case there should be an explicitly documented concept.

  [x] Concepts are a means to increase consistency

  [x] A concept can define constraints for the implementation of several building blocks.

  [x] A concept might be implemented by a single building block.
